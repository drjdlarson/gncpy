Doxygen must be installed for the documentation to be built. Also recommended to install graphviz for the documentation.

See `http://google.github.io/googletest/reference/assertions.html`_ for reference on gtest (used to write test cases).
You can use ctest to run all the tests (they are built by default when building with cmake).
